How To Use
Step 1: together with JQuery, include jquery.leanModal.min.js in your page, thusly:

<script type="text/javascript" src="path_to/jquery.leanModal.min.js"></script>
Step 2: rather than call another stylesheet, simply include the following overlay style block in your existing stylesheet. Additionally, be sure to hide your modal element with 'display: none;' (although that probably goes without saying).

#lean_overlay {
    position: fixed;
    z-index:100;
    top: 0px;
    left: 0px;
    height:100%;
    width:100%;
    background: #000;
    display: none;
}
Step 3: call the function on your modal trigger, as follows. Be sure to set the href attribute of your trigger anchor to match the id of your target element.

$("#trigger_id").leanModal();
...or, if you want more than one modal window on the same page, simply add the 'rel' attribute to your triggers, and call the function by attribute, like so:

$("a[rel*=leanModal]").leanModal();
Options
In the spirit of keeping things simple, there are only two three options involved: vertical position of the modal element in relation to the document body (default is 100px from the top), the overlay opacity (default is 0.5), and a close button option (default null). You can override these defaults by passing your desired values to the function, like so:

$("#trigger_id").leanModal({ top : 200, overlay : 0.4, closeButton: ".modal_close" });
Simple, and sweet.
